    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used for describing the presentation and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML (including XHTML). CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, in print, or in other media.</p>
    <p>CSS is essential for creating visually appealing, accessible, and responsive web pages. It empowers developers and designers to control the layout, typography, colors, and other visual aspects of web content effectively.</p>
