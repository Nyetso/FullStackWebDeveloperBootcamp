    <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
    <br>
    <p>DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation refers to the process of programmatically accessing, updating, or modifying HTML elements and attributes within a web page using JavaScript. The DOM represents the structure of a document as a hierarchical tree of nodes, where each node represents an element (such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;) or other parts of the document (like text nodes or comments).</p>
    <p>DOM manipulation with JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications. It allows developers to programmatically interact with and modify the structure, content, and behavior of web pages based on user input and application requirements.</p>
