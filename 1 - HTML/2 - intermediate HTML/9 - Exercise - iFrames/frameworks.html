    <h1>JavaScript Frameworks</h1>
    <br>
    <p>JavaScript frameworks are libraries or sets of pre-written code that provide developers with standardized solutions for common tasks and challenges in web development. These frameworks typically offer a collection of tools, functions, and components that streamline the development process, improve code organization, and enhance productivity.</p>
    <p>Here are some popular JavaScript frameworks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>React.js</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>Vue.js</li>
        <li>Svelte</li>
        <li>Ember.js</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each JavaScript framework has its strengths and is suited for different types of projects and development workflows. Choosing the right framework depends on your project goals, team expertise, and specific requirements for scalability, performance, and maintainability.</p>
