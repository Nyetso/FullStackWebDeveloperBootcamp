                It’s not exactly a secret that one of the best parts of going on vacation is sampling 
                the local cuisine at your destination. This is particularly true when you travel to a 
                city known for its five-star restaurants (looking at you, New York, LA, Chicago, San Francisco, 
                Asheville, and the list goes on).
            </P>
            <P>
                Of course, those multicourse meals prepared by Michelin-star chefs aren’t without consequence — 
                particularly when it comes to your bank account. When home is a kitchen-less hotel and you’re eating 
                all your meals out, things get expensive real fast.
            </P>
            <p>
                So how can you try the best of what the city you’re traveling to has to offer without ending up 
                with a credit card bill that makes you wish you’d never gone on vacation at all? We asked financial 
                and travel experts. Here’s what they had to say.

            <header><h3>Take advantage of breakfast buffets.</h3></header>
            <p>
                If you want to splurge on an expensive dinner, don’t turn your nose up at your hotel’s free breakfast 
                buffet. “One of the simplest ways to save is to take full advantage of any free meals your 
                accommodation may offer,” said <a href="#">Erika Kullberg</a>, an attorney and personal finance expert. 
                “Many hotels provide complimentary breakfasts; some might even offer buffet-style meals 
                that can be substantial enough to keep you full for much of the day.”

            <header><h3>Skip the cocktails.</h3></header>
            <p>
                No, we’re not giving you this tip to help you avoid a hangover — although that’s certainly a plus. 
                “Drinks, particularly alcoholic beverages, can quickly increase your restaurant bill,” Kullberg said. 
                “Skipping cocktails and wine and opting for tap water or a smaller beverage like a local beer can 
                drastically cut costs. If you do wish to try a local drink, consider limiting it to one and savor 
                it as part of your culinary experience.”
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do want to drink, <a href="#">Joshua Scott</a>, director of food and beverage at Kimpton Harper Hotel in 
                Fort Worth, Texas, suggests finding a good happy hour spot. “This can provide you with the same 
                amazing food or beverages, but at a highly discounted price,” he said.

            <header><h3>Stock up on snacks.</h3></header>
            <p>
                Whether it’s before you leave or once you get to your destination, stocking up on a handful of filling 
                snacks is a smart move. “Getting some granola bars or other cheap snacks at the store can help 
                you avoid feelings of hunger during the day,” said <a href="#">Scott Lieberman</a>, founder of Touchdown Money. 
                “If you’re planning to visit top restaurants, you don’t want to waste money on common eats out 
                of sheer hunger.”

            <header><h3>Check for discounts.</h3></header>
            <p>
                Even fancy restaurants have deals from time to time, according to Lieberman. “Searching their 
                website or local coupon books can yield major savings,” he said.

                <a href="#">Giacomo Piva</a>, a travel industry analyst and founder of the travel blog Radical Storage, added 
                that certain apps can help you find discounts and deals on local restaurants. “Apps like <a href="#">TheFork</a> 
                can help you uncover and book restaurants offering special discounts with stellar reviews from 
                locals and tourists,” he said.

            <header><h3>Find other ways to cut back on spending.</h3></header>
            <p>
                If food is your main priority while traveling, affordable luxury travel and personal finance expert 
                <a href="#">Danielle Desir Corbett</a> says there are tons of other ways to save. “Find restaurants near your accommodation, 
                ideally within walking distance, to help you avoid public transportation expenses, Uber rides or potential 
                parking fees,” she said. “Additionally, some hotels may partner with local eateries, offering the chance 
                to enjoy special discounts. Don’t forget to check the tourism boards’ website for exclusive dining packages, 
                deals, and upcoming restaurant events.”

            <header><h3>Skip the protein and double up on apps.</h3></header>
            <p>
                While this may be unpopular nutrition advice, Corbett says skipping out on added protein is a great way 
                to save. “Skip the protein add-on, like shrimp, chicken, or steak, which is often optional for salads and 
                pasta dishes,” she said. “Choose the smaller portion option instead of the large one, and to sample a wider 
                variety, consider picking two appetizers [instead of a main course].”

            <header><h3>Eat like a local.</h3></header>
            <p>
                Locals who live in a foodie city may appreciate all the provisions their town has to offer, but that 
                doesn’t mean they’re indulging in them regularly. “To really dive into the local cuisine without spending 
                a fortune, don’t overlook street food and local markets,” Kullberg said. “These venues often offer some of 
                the most authentic and delicious insights into local food culture at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. 
                It’s also a great way to interact with locals and discover dishes that you might not find in a more formal 
                setting.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you’re feeling bold, instead of searching on Google for highly rated restaurants, talk to the locals. 
                “If a restaurant is highly rated on Google, it usually means it’s popular with tourists and therefore more 
                pricey), ask locals you meet on the street where they go to eat,” Kullberg added.
            </p>
            <p>
                While travel is always going to be a little pricey — especially if you’re traveling to an expensive 
                destination — there are ways to eat at great restaurants without going broke. With a little planning 
                and careful ordering, you’ll return home well-fed and happy.
